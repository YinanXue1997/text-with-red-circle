<p class="p1"> By abandoning the anguish of New York action Painting, and instead, delighting in pure and open color, the Washington color painters changed the look of abstract art. Though Howard Mehring's pictures from the 1950s are not as famous or as costly as those by his older colleagues, Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, it is in Mr. Mehring's paintings that the move to the new style is most clearly seen.</p>


<p class="p2"> Though it is sure that he was influenced by the dripped canvases of Jackson Pollack, Mr. Mehring found a way of opening the field through hue instead of line. But as he kept on painting, and began to use hard edges, that lovely, airy openness began to lock, to close. Though they retained a mood of urgency, of passion, his works grew ever stricter until, in 1968, the artist ceased to paint.

Mr. Mehring, it was clear, had not lost his love of painting. He visited the National Gallery of Art almost every day. He loved to discuss painting. When asked why he had stopped, he grew evasive. Some of his admirers felt he'd lost his nerve.</p>
